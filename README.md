# Integrating_SCM_SD
Intergrating the Stereotype Content Model(SCM), Dual Perspective Model (DPM) and Semantic Differential (SD) by word embeddings techniques.

## Study 1: Constructing contrasting pairs by mce alrorithms

In this study, I will show how to construct contrasting pairs by mce algorithms.
- The seed words of SCM from Nicolas et al.'s stereotype content dictionaries.[Comprehensive stereotype content dictionaries using a semi-automated method](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ejsp.2724)
- The seed words of DPM from Pietraszkiewicz et al.'s big two dictionaries. [The big two dictionaries: Capturing agency and communion in natural language](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ejsp.2561)
- SD doesn't need this step. because they has provide pairs.
